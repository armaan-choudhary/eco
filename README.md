# [cite_start]Prakriti: Let's Heal Our Planet, One Challenge at a Time! [cite: 1]

## [cite_start]Problem Statement [cite: 2]

[cite_start]Despite the rising urgency of climate change and environmental degradation, environmental education remains largely theoretical in many Indian schools and colleges[cite: 3]. [cite_start]Students are often taught textbook-based content with little emphasis on real-world application, local ecological issues, or personal responsibility[cite: 4]. [cite_start]There is a lack of engaging tools that motivate students to adopt eco-friendly practices or understand the direct consequences of their lifestyle choices[cite: 5]. [cite_start]Traditional methods fail to instill sustainable habits or inspire youth participation in local environmental efforts[cite: 6].

### [cite_start]The Problem (Simplified) [cite: 7]
* [cite_start]**Boring Textbooks:** Environmental education in India is often stuck in books, disconnected from the real world[cite: 8]. [cite_start]Students learn facts but don't feel inspired to act[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**No Real-World Connection:** There's a huge gap between knowing about climate change and actually doing something like segregating waste or conserving water[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Lost Motivation:** Without engaging tools, students aren't motivated to adopt green habits[cite: 10]. [cite_start]The urgency is lost in theoretical lessons[cite: 10].

## [cite_start]Our Solution: Prakriti! [cite: 11]

[cite_start]Welcome to Prakriti an app that makes saving the planet fun and addictive, just like Duolingo makes learning a language! [cite: 12] [cite_start]We're turning eco-education into a nationwide game[cite: 13].

* [cite_start]**Learn & Act:** Bite-sized, interactive lessons on local environmental issues[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]**Gamified Challenges:** Real-world tasks like planting a sapling, segregating waste, or having a no-plastic day[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]**Fight for Good:** A negative mascot, "Keechak" (the spirit of pollution!), grows stronger every day[cite: 17]. [cite_start]Players team up to weaken him by completing challenges and maintaining their "green streaks"! [cite: 18]

## [cite_start]MVP Core Features [cite: 19]

[cite_start]For our MVP, we're focusing on the core gameplay loop: [cite: 20]

* [cite_start]**Daily Green Quests:** A simple, rotating list of actionable tasks to build habits[cite: 21].
* [cite_start]**Karma Points & Streaks:** Users earn points for each quest and build a personal streak for consecutive days of activity[cite: 22].
* [cite_start]**Badges & Unlockables:** Reward users with cool, shareable badges for hitting streak milestones (e.g., "7-Day Eco-Warrior," "30-Day Planet Hero") and achieving Karma point levels[cite: 23].
* [cite_start]**Global Leaderboard:** A single, nationwide leaderboard to foster a sense of collective competition and progress[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]**The Fight Against Keechak:** Keechak's health will be a global metric that decreases as users collectively earn Karma Points[cite: 26, 27]. [cite_start]A simple, powerful visual of our shared impact[cite: 27].

[cite_start]_(Features like City-vs-City competitions and Teacher Dashboards are planned for future versions!)_ [cite: 28]

## [cite_start]MVP Plan & Tech Stack [cite: 29]

[cite_start]Our plan is focused on rapid development and a functional prototype with flexible roles[cite: 30].

### [cite_start]Frontend [cite: 31]
[cite_start]The frontend team's priority is to build a slick, intuitive, and engaging user experience[cite: 32]. [cite_start]By using React Native with Expo, we can develop quickly for both iOS and Android from a single codebase[cite: 33]. [cite_start]The focus will be on the core screens that drive the user journey, using animations to make the app feel alive and rewarding[cite: 34].

| Task/Responsibility | Technology/Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| Build Core UI/UX | [cite_start]React Native, Expo [cite: 35] |
| Simple State Management | [cite_start]React Context API [cite: 35] |
| Engaging Animations | [cite_start]Lottie [cite: 35] |
| Implement Key Screens | [cite_start]Login, Dashboard, Leaderboard, Profile/Badges [cite: 35] |

### [cite_start]Backend [cite: 36]
[cite_start]The backend team is responsible for creating a fast and reliable engine for the app[cite: 37]. [cite_start]FastAPI is chosen for its high performance and ease of use, which is perfect for a hackathon[cite: 38]. [cite_start]They will build the API endpoints that the frontend will communicate with, implementing the core game mechanics that make Prakriti engaging[cite: 39].

| Task/Responsibility | Technology/Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| Develop Core API | [cite_start]Python, FastAPI [cite: 40] |
| Database Management | [cite_start]PostgreSQL [cite: 40] |
| Implement Game Logic | [cite_start]Streaks, Karma, Badges, Keechak's Health [cite: 40] |
| User Authentication | [cite_start]JWT or similar [cite: 40] |

### [cite_start]Infrastructure/Deployment [cite: 41]
[cite_start]This role is critical for bringing our project to life[cite: 42]. [cite_start]The goal is to get the backend running in the cloud as quickly as possible[cite: 43]. [cite_start]Using a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) like Heroku or Vercel abstracts away complex server management, allowing us to deploy with a few commands and ensuring our app is accessible for the final demo[cite: 44].

| Task/Responsibility | Technology/Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| Rapid Backend Deployment | [cite_start]Heroku / Vercel (PaaS) [cite: 45] |
| Database Setup | [cite_start]Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL (e.g., on Heroku) [cite: 45] |
| [cite_start]Ensure App is Live | [cite: 45] |

## [cite_start]Why It Will Work [cite: 46]

* [cite_start]**Taps into Competition:** Leaderboards and streaks create a powerful motivation to participate daily[cite: 47].
* [cite_start]**Story-Driven & Interactive:** We're not just a task list[cite: 48]. [cite_start]A compelling story (fighting Keechak) and high interactivity keep users hooked, which is crucial for today's short attention spans[cite: 49].
* [cite_start]**Makes Impact Visible:** Seeing "Keechak" shrink gives users instant, gratifying feedback that their actions matter[cite: 51].
* [cite_start]**Community Power:** Pits cities and schools against each other for a common good, fostering a sense of collective responsibility[cite: 52].
* [cite_start]**NEP 2020 Aligned:** Perfectly fits the national push for experiential and hands-on learning[cite: 53].

## [cite_start]Impact & Vision [cite: 54]

[cite_start]Our goal is to create a generation of environmentally conscious citizens[cite: 55]. With Prakriti, we can:

* [cite_start]**Empower Youth:** Give students the tools to make a tangible difference[cite: 56].
* [cite_start]**Build Green Habits:** Turn one-time actions into lifelong sustainable practices[cite: 57].
* [cite_start]**Create a Greener India:** Foster a nationwide movement where every small action contributes to a larger, positive change[cite: 58].
