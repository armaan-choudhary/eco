🌍 Prakriti: Let's Heal Our Planet, One Challenge at a Time!
Problem Statement
Despite the rising urgency of climate change and environmental degradation, environmental
education remains largely theoretical in many Indian schools and colleges. Students are often
taught textbook-based content with little emphasis on real-world application, local ecological
issues, or personal responsibility.
There is a lack of engaging tools that motivate students to adopt eco-friendly practices or
understand the direct consequences of their lifestyle choices. Traditional methods fail to instill
sustainable habits or inspire youth participation in local environmental efforts.
The Problem (Simplified) 🤔
● Boring Textbooks 📚: Environmental education in India is often stuck in books,
disconnected from the real world. Students learn facts but don't feel inspired to act.
● No Real-World Connection 🤷: There's a huge gap between knowing about climate
change and actually doing something like segregating waste or conserving water.
● Lost Motivation 📉: Without engaging tools, students aren't motivated to adopt green
habits. The urgency is lost in theoretical lessons.
Our Solution: Prakriti! ✨
Welcome to Prakriti – an app that makes saving the planet fun and addictive, just like
Duolingo makes learning a language!
We're turning eco-education into a nationwide game.
● Learn & Act 🤓: Bite-sized, interactive lessons on local environmental issues.
● Gamified Challenges 🏆: Real-world tasks like planting a sapling, segregating waste, or
having a no-plastic day.
● Fight for Good ⚔️: A negative mascot, "Keechak" (the spirit of pollution!), grows
stronger every day. Players team up to weaken him by completing challenges and
maintaining their "green streaks"!
MVP Core Features 🎮
For our MVP, we're focusing on the core gameplay loop:
● Daily Green Quests ✅: A simple, rotating list of actionable tasks to build habits.
● Karma Points & Streaks 🔥: Users earn points for each quest and build a personal
streak for consecutive days of activity.
● Badges & Unlockables 🏅: Reward users with cool, shareable badges for hitting streak
milestones (e.g., "7-Day Eco-Warrior," "30-Day Planet Hero") and achieving Karma point
levels.
● Global Leaderboard 📈: A single, nationwide leaderboard to foster a sense of collective
competition and progress.
● The Fight Against Keechak 👺➡️😇: Keechak's health will be a global metric that
decreases as users collectively earn Karma Points. A simple, powerful visual of our shared
impact.
(Features like City-vs-City competitions and Teacher Dashboards are planned for future
versions!)
MVP Plan & Tech Stack 💻
Our plan is focused on rapid development and a functional prototype with flexible roles.
Frontend
📱 The frontend team's priority is to build a slick, intuitive, and engaging user experience. By
using React Native with Expo, we can develop quickly for both iOS and Android from a single
codebase. The focus will be on the core screens that drive the user journey, using animations
to make the app feel alive and rewarding.
Task/Responsibility Technology/Tools
Build Core UI/UX React Native, Expo
Simple State Management React Context API
Engaging Animations Lottie
Implement Key Screens Login, Dashboard, Leaderboard,
Profile/Badges
Backend
⚙️ The backend team is responsible for creating a fast and reliable engine for the app.
FastAPI is chosen for its high performance and ease of use, which is perfect for a hackathon.
They will build the API endpoints that the frontend will communicate with, implementing the
core game mechanics that make Prakriti engaging.
Task/Responsibility Technology/Tools
Develop Core API Python, FastAPI
Database Management PostgreSQL
Implement Game Logic Streaks, Karma, Badges, Keechak's Health
User Authentication JWT or similar
Infrastructure/Deployment
☁️ This role is critical for bringing our project to life. The goal is to get the backend running in
the cloud as quickly as possible. Using a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) like Heroku or Vercel
abstracts away complex server management, allowing us to deploy with a few commands and
ensuring our app is accessible for the final demo.
Task/Responsibility Technology/Tools
Rapid Backend Deployment Heroku / Vercel (PaaS)
Database Setup Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL (e.g., on
Heroku)
Ensure App is Live -
Why It Will Work 🚀
● Taps into Competition 🔥: Leaderboards and streaks create a powerful motivation to
participate daily.
● Story-Driven & Interactive 📖: We're not just a task list. A compelling story (fighting
Keechak) and high interactivity keep users hooked, which is crucial for today's short
attention spans.
● Makes Impact Visible 👀: Seeing "Keechak" shrink gives users instant, gratifying
feedback that their actions matter.
● Community Power 🤝: Pits cities and schools against each other for a common good,
fostering a sense of collective responsibility.
● NEP 2020 Aligned ✔️: Perfectly fits the national push for experiential and hands-on
learning.
Impact & Vision 🌟
Our goal is to create a generation of environmentally conscious citizens. With Prakriti, we can:
● Empower Youth 💪: Give students the tools to make a tangible difference.
● Build Green Habits 🌱: Turn one-time actions into lifelong sustainable practices.
● Create a Greener India : Foster a nationwide movement where every small action
contributes to a larger, positive change.
Join us, and let's turn every student into an Eco-Warrior! 🌱
